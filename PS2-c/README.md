PS2 PORT OF Untitled Cass Game FOR THE PLAYSTATION 2

WRITTEN BY: TechCat-Git

Yes, this is a lot more bulkier than the rest, but a lot of code is needed for a basic PS2 executable w/ controller supoort.

A pre-compiled .ELF file is included and can be loaded with PCSX2, or on real hardware with your favorite Homebrew ELF loader.

The source code can also be compiled using PS2SDK.
